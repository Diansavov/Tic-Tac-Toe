Looking back half a year later this is the most disgusting and vile code I have ever written...


!!!WARNING!!!
This code is known to give cancer to any average programmer.
Some other risks may include:
-A skin rash on your eyes from the beautiful if/else statments
-Vile vomit from the way the css is written
-A nose bleed, when you hit your head on the desk because the html is ...
-And the last known symptom is massive headache for atleast 3 days (as the cure for the deppression will be alcohol you may become an alcoholic)


If anyone wants to make this "beautiful" code even better they should do so at their own risk!
!GOOD LUCK!
